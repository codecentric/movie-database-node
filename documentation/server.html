    If you are reading this, then you are probably here because one of the
    trainers has given you this URI. If not, then most of this information
    may not be of interest to you. Should you be interested in this
    workshop, please contact our
    <a href="mailto:agilejs@codecentric.de">training team</a> (workshop is
    available in German and English).

  <h2>Server-Side: Node.JS, Express.JS</h2>
  <p>
    The server-implementation has two responsibilities: On the one hand it serves static files for the AngularJS Frontend. On the other hand it provides (REST-)interface to our persistence layer.
  </p>

  <h3>Static Files</h3>
  <p>
    Every request that points directly to a file inside the <code>client</code> directory is simply answered by serving exactly the requested file. For example, a request to <code>/js/lib/angular.js</code> will result in the file <code>/client/js/lib/angular.js</code> being served. <strong>Moreover, any other request, that does not include a <code>Accept: application/json</code> header will result in the <code>index.html</code> file being served!</strong> For more information on this behaviour, see the <a href="https://github.com/bripkens/connect-history-api-fallback">History API Fallback</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>REST-API</h3>
  <p> The easiest way to explain the REST-API is by example (using curl): </p>
  <pre>$ curl -v -XGET \
    -H "Accept: application/json" \
    http://localhost:3000/movies
> GET /movies HTTP/1.1
> User-Agent: curl/7.27.0
> Host: localhost:3000
> Accept: application/json
> 
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
