    If you are reading this, then you are probably here because one of the
    trainers has given you this URI. If not, then most of this information
    may not be of interest to you. Should you be interested in this
    workshop, please contact our
    <a href="mailto:agilejs@codecentric.de">training team</a> (workshop is
    available in German and English).
  </p>

  <h2>Installation of necessary software</h2>
  <p>
    Make sure that every team member has a PC/Mac that can be used for
    development. Unix based operating systems work best in our experience, but
    Windows can also be used. If you are willing to, then you can install the
    necessary software on your own machine. Being able to run the software
    outside of any virtual machine is superb and will result in the best
    experience for you during the workshop. For those who are unable to install
    the software or are not willing to, we provide an Ubuntu-based virtual
    machine that can be run using
    <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">Oracle VirtualBox</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>Native installation</h3>
  <p>
    Providing installation instructions for all the tools is out of scope for
    this document. Most of the necessary tools feature an excellent
    documentation that you can refer to should you run into any issues. In case
    of any outstanding issues, please contact us by mail through
    <a href="mailto:agilejs@codecentric.de?subject=Setup problems">
      agilejs@codecentric.de</a>.
  </p>

  <p>Please make sure that the following tools are installed:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html">
        Java version 6 or later
      </a>
       (preferably Oracle JDK or Open JDK 7)</li>
    <li>
      <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a> (the version control system)
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.JS version 10 and NPM</a>
      (node package manager). On OS X and Linux you should use
      <a href="https://github.com/creationix/nvm">NVM</a>
      (Node Version Manager) which allows you to install global modules without
      super user privileges. To install NVM you need to have git and cURL
      installed.
    </li>
    <li>
      Once NPM is installed, you will need to globally install the Grunt
      command line interface. You can do so by running
      <code>npm install -g grunt-cli</code>. Depending on your setup, you might
      need to prepend <code>sudo</code> to get the necessary privileges.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="http://phantomjs.org/">PhantomJS</a> to execute the tests
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="http://www.neo4j.org/">Neo4j</a> as this is the database that
      we are using. Installation normally only requires an extraction of the
      downloaded archive.
    </li>
    <li>
      Some code editor that supports HTML, CSS and JavaScript. We
      recommend either
      <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a> or
      <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/">WebStorm</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      At last, you will need a relatively new web browser. Chromium derivatives
      like Google Chrome, Chrome Canary or Chromium itself would be our choice.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Using the Virtual Machine</h3>
  <p>
    Make sure that you have
    <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">Oracle VirtualBox</a> installed.
    With VirtualBox Version 4.X (where X is larger than 1) you should not run
    into any issues. Once installed you can start VirtualBox and import the
    virtual machine using <em>File -> Import Appliance</em>. Follow the wizard
    till the end and start the virtual machine. You should now be good to go!
